# CZ-SK-hosts-file-to-block-trackers-and-ads
Hosts files to block the most common trackers and ad-related domains found on the internet.

These host files block tracking domains that are not included in other lists (including EasyList CZ/SK), such as some Czech and Slovak trackers.

Optionally, you can choose hosts files completely blocking Facebook. Even if you block Facebook in your browser, apps are commonly connecting to Facebook domains (api.facebook.com and graph.facebook.com) for tracking purposes.
